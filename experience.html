    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
    <h3>1. Internship at Maven Silicon - VLSI Design</h3>
    <h5> My Overview</h5> 
    <ul>
        <li>I completed a Virtual Long-Term Internship in VLSI Design at Maven Silicon Softech Pvt. Ltd., organized by the Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education in collaboration with Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Kakinada. This virtual internship was a part of my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering program and spanned 240 hours. It provided an in-depth look into the world of VLSI Design, a key area that I am deeply interested in.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>My Experience</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>
            Although the internship was conducted remotely, the experience was highly engaging and enriching. Throughout the internship, I was introduced to VLSI design tools and techniques used in the industry. Despite being virtual, the mentorship provided by industry professionals was valuable, and the resources were accessible online, enabling me to gain hands-on knowledge of VLSI circuit design, simulation, and testing processes.
        </li> 
        <li>
            The flexibility of the virtual internship allowed me to manage my time effectively while balancing my academic schedule. Online collaboration with mentors and peers provided me with ample opportunities to discuss complex topics, solve real-time problems, and receive feedback that helped me improve my technical skills.
        </li>
        <li>
            The virtual setting also enhanced my ability to work independently and develop strong self-discipline while learning at my own pace. The internship helped me better understand the VLSI design lifecycle and gave me insight into industry practices, all while honing my communication and problem-solving skills.\
        </li>
        <li>
            This virtual internship experience was a significant milestone in my educational journey, enabling me to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical industry applications.
